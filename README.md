Find All Duplicates: Write a function (or a static method in the case of Java)
that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that
appear more than once. 

Java method: Add every number to a "unique" list. If you get to a number that is in the unique list, then add it to a "duplicates"
list. Make sure to check that the number is not in the duplicates list (so we see only one of each number that is repeated).

Python method: For every item in the list, compare it to every item after. If it matches any there must be a duplicate. 
Add this to the "duplicates" list.
